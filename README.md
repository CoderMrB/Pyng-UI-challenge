<em>A challenge from a fintech startup to recreate a high-fi wireframe!</em>

Could I recreate their landing page wireframe using a tool I hadn't encountered before- React Native?

By the end of the day - (time being split with looking after a poorly daughter off school!) - I was able to show the finished landing page.

The image on the left shows Pyng's Figma wireframe, and the image on the right is my implentation in React Native (running on an LG smartphone).

I met one of the founders of Pyng at the School of Code demo day and since then I've got to hear about their impressive journey so far. Pyng is an app that will allow friends to pay each other quickly and seamlessly using their smartphones - in the same way as is already possible when paying for your shopping. (Ideal for splitting the bill quickly and easily at the pub after a couple of drinks!)

It was good fun getting to grips with React Native using expo for the first time, always good to have a new tool in the toolbox! There were some challenges - such as figuring out how to get custom fonts into react native using expo, and setting up a custom button component with a set stylesheet, but with some customisable styling properties passed as props. But I found react native / expo to be pretty intuitive and enjoyable to use.

I was really pleased to have been able to incorporate the company font, and to have noticed a very subtle border on one of the buttons that I almost missed!

A good day's learning and a fun challenge - thanks to the guys at Pyng!
