# Pyng-UI-challenge
A challenge from a fintech startup to recreate a high-fi wireframe!

Could I recreate their high-fi landing page wireframe using a tool I hadn't encoutered yet - React Native?

24 hours later (held up a little by an unwell daughter being off school, and working with expo go on a nearly-ancient smartphone!) - I was able to present the finished landing page.

The image on the left shows the figma wireframe, and the image on the right is the implentation in react native running on an LG smartphone.

This was a challenge set to me by the founders of Pyng - an exciting new fintech startup.

I met one of the founders of Pyng at the School of Code demo day and we've been in contact since, and I've got to hear about their impressive journey so far.

Pyng is an app that will allow friends to pay each other quickly and seamlessly using their smartphones - in the same way as is already possible when paying for your shopping. (Ideal for splitting the bill quickly and easily at the pub after a couple of drinks!)

After sharing my story with Pyng they gave me a challenge -





It was great fun learning a new tool by using React Native using expo. The main challenges were figuring out how to get custom fonts into the app, and setting up a custom button component using largely the same style, but with some adjustable styling properties passed as props. But overall I found react native / expo to be pretty intuitive and enjoyable to use.

I was really pleased to have been able to incorporate the company font, and to have noticed a very subtle border on one of the buttons that I almost missed!

A good day's learning and a fun challenge - thanks to the guys at Pyng!
